#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product= "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customers.order_id=Feb.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price 
IN (Select MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price 
AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price 
AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON FEB.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2;
